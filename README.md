 ### Future plans
 Since this was quite a short project, in the future I would like to dedicate more time to overall styling of the app, also add more functionality and become more familiar with the Github GraphQL API.
Other than that, I will focus more time towards the testing, to make the app more robust.

#Feedback

I think it was really interesting using the GraphQL API, by the higher usage of the query language, I am starting to see more benefits about the usefulness of GraphQL, and considering it for future projects:
